📚 Book Recommender System

Book Recommender System is a collaborative filtering-based web application that recommends books to users based on their ratings and preferences. Users receive personalized suggestions by analyzing their past interactions and similarities with other users.

🔧 Features

The project follows an end-to-end pipeline starting with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand user behavior, book popularity, and rating patterns. It then builds a collaborative filtering model to predict and recommend books accurately. An interactive web interface is developed using Flask, allowing users to explore book recommendations in real time.

🛠️ Technologies Used

This project leverages Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and modeling. Jupyter Notebook is used for building the ML pipeline, while Flask and Render handle web deployment for public access.
